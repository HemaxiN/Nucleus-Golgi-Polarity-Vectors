# A CNN-GNN Approach for Polarity Vectors Prediction in 3D Microscopy Images
Official implementation of the paper submitted to the 2024 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, to be held in Orlando, Florida, USA, July 15-19, 2024.[https://embc.embs.org/2024/](https://embc.embs.org/2024/).


* The implementation of the CNN for nuclei and Golgi detection is available [here](https://github.com/HemaxiN/Nucleus-Golgi-Polarity-Vectors/tree/main/CNN).
* The implementation of the GNN for nucleus-Golgi link prediction is available [here](https://github.com/HemaxiN/Nucleus-Golgi-Polarity-Vectors/tree/main/GNN).
